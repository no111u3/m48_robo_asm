# m48_robo_asm
My atmega48 asm robotics and control engineering experiments

# build procedure

For build these examples I use my handwritten version of AVRA: AVRA-RS(https://github.com/no111u3/avra-rs). Because I fix some bugs in assembler, for example, I rewrite it in Rust.
You can install it by cargo: `cargo install avra-rs`
